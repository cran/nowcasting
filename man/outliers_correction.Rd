\description{
This function operates in two stages. First, it substitutes missings and outliers for the median
Outliers are definited as observations that its distance from median is more than 4 times the IQR (Interquartile Range).
Second, a \code{k_ma} moving average is filtered in each serie, and its values are used to replace outliers and missings in the original data set.
