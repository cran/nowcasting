Description: Methods and tools for 'forecast' the current state (nowcast) of Brazilian economic time series. It allows extract information in real time, creating a real time data base; estimate relationship between macroeconomic variables via estimation of dynamic factors; forecast time series in previous periods of reference; forecast time series in the current period of reference (nowcasting); recreate a data base simulating the information available in the past for evaluating forecasting models accuracy.  The econometric framework we follow is proposed in Giannone et al. (2008) <doi:10.1016/j.jmoneco.2008.05.010>.
