Description: Methods and tools to estimate 'forecasts' of Brazilian macroeconomic variables in the near future or the recent past, i.e. 'nowcast'. It allows: extract information in real time, creating a real time data base; estimate relationship between macroeconomic variables via dynamic factors; forecast time series in previous periods of reference; forecast time series in the current period of reference (nowcasting); recreate a data base simulating the information available in the past for evaluating forecasting models accuracy (pseudo real-time data base); access information available in a specific date in the past (real-time data base), for some variables.
